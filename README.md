## Abstract
California faces cycles of drought and flooding that are projected to intensify, but these extremes may impact water users across the state differently due to the region’s natural hydroclimate variability and complex institutional framework governing water deliveries. To assess these risks, this study introduces a novel exploratory modeling framework informed by paleo- and climate-change based scenarios to better understand how impacts propagate through California’s complex water system. A stochastic weather generator, conditioned on tree-ring data, produces a large ensemble of daily weather sequences conditioned on drought and flood conditions under the Late Renaissance Megadrought period (1550-1580 CE). Regional climate changes are applied to this weather data and drive hydrologic projections for the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Tulare Basins. The resulting streamflow ensembles are used in an exploratory stress test using the California Food-Energy-Water System model (CALFEWS), a highly resolved, daily model of water storage and conveyance throughout California. Results show that megadrought conditions lead to unprecedented reductions in inflows and storage at major California reservoirs. Both junior and senior water rights holders experience multi-year periods of curtailed water deliveries and complete drawdowns of groundwater assets. When megadrought dynamics are combined with climate change, risks for unprecedented depletion of reservoir storage and sustained curtailment of water deliveries across multiple years emerge. Asymmetries in risk emerge depending on water source, rights, and access to groundwater banks.

## Contributing modeling software
| Model | Version | Repository Link | DOI |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----|
| CALFEWS- Historical | V 1.0 | https://github.com/hbz5000/CALFEWS |10.5281/zenodo.4091708|


## Reproduce my experiment

There are two components to this study: (1) produce input files for CALFEWS and (2) run CALFEWS under historical, paleo, and climate change scenarios and synthesize the output. 

### Produce Input Files
Full natural flow and snow that serves as an input into CALFEWS can be found in the “hydroclimate” folder in the MSD-Live repository. The streamflow is sorted into CDEC, Paleo, and 4T, 1CC (the selected climate change scenario). 

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make_subfolder.sh`| This bash script creates a folder structure to store the input data for CALFEWS. It creates a folder for the baseline (0T, 0CC) and climate change scenarios, all 50 ensemble members, and each 30-year section| `sbatch make_subfolder.sh` |
| `splitting_script.R`, `splitting_script_CC.R` | These scripts take the streamflow and snow and partition them into 30-year periods for the baseline and climate change scenarios. For this study, we just use period "6" which corresponds to 1550-1580, though the user can create inputs for any section| `sbatch split_datasets.sh` |
| `initialize_params.sh` | This script creates the `base_inflows.json` file needed to initialize CALFEWS. It adjusts the file to take in the location of the 30-year dataset | `python3 step_two.py -o /path/to/my/outputdir` |


### Running Historical CALFEWS 

Baseline values using modeled SAC-SMA historical flows are generated by running CALFEWS with a few changes that are found in `./run_baseline_CALFEWS`. 

1. Clone the CALFEWS repository from: `https://github.com/hbz5000/CALFEWS`
2. Swap out the `./runtime_parameters.ini` with the new one in `./run_baseline_CALFEWS`. This sets the input source to be the historical sacsma_dataset
3. Add in  `sacsma_baseline.csv` and `sacsma_data.csv` to `./calfews_src/data/input/`
4. Swap out the `base_inflows.json` file with the one in `./run_baseline_CALFEWS`
5. Swap out `main_cy.pyx` with the one in `./run_baseline_CALFEWS`

Follow the directions in the CALFEWS readme to run this version of CALFEWS. The output will be a `results.hdf5` file.    

### Running Paleo or Climate Change- Forced CALFEWS 

1. Running CALFEWS under paleo and climate change scenarios uses the CALFEWS model created above. However, we can run CALFEWS in batch across multiple ensembles of inputs that we generated above and that we will store in respective folders. 

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run_calfews.py`| This bash script runs CALFEWS for a specific paleo or climate change scenario and ensemble member. A `results.hdf` file will be created in respective output folders| `sbatch run_calfews.sh` |

### Creating Intermediary Scripts 

Once the results files are created, a variety of scripts are used to aggregate the results into intermediary products to be used in the plotting scripts. 

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make_quantile_products.py`| This script creates the baseline and climate change products for Figure 5| `python make_quantile_products.py` |
| `make_reservoir_pkls.py`| This script creates reservoir storage files for Figure 6| `python make_reservoir_pkls.py` |
| `contract_deliveries.py`| This script creates aggregate datasets for contract deliveries for multiple figures| `contract_deliveries.py` |
| `delta_cummulative_risk.py`| This script creates aggregate datasets the delta cummulative risk lineplot in Figure 10| `delta_cummulative_risk.py` |
